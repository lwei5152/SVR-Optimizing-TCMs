# SVR-Optimizing-TCMs
This is an example showing how Machine learning used in Materials Sciences.
 
1. A support vector machine with radial basis function kernel helps to optimize CuZnS thin films via chemical bath deposition method;
2. Four parameters are chosen with different levels, experiments were done to get FOMs (calculated using transmittance at 380-780 nm and sheet resistance according to Haacke, G. J. Appl. Phys. 1976, 47, 4086â€“4089).
3. The actual optimization were done for twice, the second round experiments were chosen as the optimized conditions from the first round. 
4. 10-fold cross validation is used to validate the fitting and select suitable hyperparameters.
